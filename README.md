Hey, this is my portfolio. It's home page has a picture of me and a short bio.
There is also a contact me page with a form asking for some user inputs.
The portfolio page is currently full of dead links and placeholder images, but 
I'm sure that will be fixed as time goes on. 
It is mobile responsive as far as I have tested it, but just in case it isn't: 

"Ask not for whom the code breaks, it breaks for thee."
